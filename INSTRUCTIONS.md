<h1>CSC435: Homework 4</h1>
</center>
<hr />
<p>Now that you have solid knowledge of the web stack, in Homework 4 you will explore the contemporary way to build web applications by using a framework with modern features and processes -- Scala Play (in Java, unless you already know Scala).</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://www.playframework.com/">Scala Play</a> home page and dig in. I recommend you follow the tutorials, starting with the conveniently named "Getting Started" section. When you get to templates, I highly recommend following the play-java-intro one. Its documentation consists of a good explanatory video.</p>
<p>This week I want you to make meaningful progress on recreating your project in Play -- it is small enough to be redone easily, once you familiarize yourself with the architecture. No need for a data store or actual web services yet, but I want to see the MVC part. Use dummy data as necessary.</p>
<p>Submit to the Blackboard dropbox your archived (zip or tar.gz) project directory, following the recommended Play directory structure. <b>Each group member</b> must make a submission to receive a grade. As usual, demonstrate the working code within a week after the deadline.</p>
